# Sales-Dashboard-Excel
Interactive sales Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel 
📊 Sales Performance Dashboard (Microsoft Excel)
📌 Project Overview

This project involved building a professional and interactive Sales Dashboard in Microsoft Excel using a real-world transactional dataset of 5,000 sales records.

The goal was to transform raw sales data into clear, actionable business insights that help management understand performance, identify risks, and make informed strategic decisions — without needing technical expertise.

The final output is an executive-ready dashboard that answers three critical business questions:
What is happening?
Why is it happening?
What should we do next?

🎯 Business Objectives
The dashboard was designed to help management:
Understand overall sales performance at a glance
Track year-over-year revenue growth
Identify top products and top customers
Detect revenue concentration and business risk
Support sales strategy and resource allocation decisions

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains 5,000 sales transactions with the following fields:
Order ID
Date
Product ID
Customer ID
Employee ID
Quantity Sold
Unit Price
From this data, key metrics such as Revenue, Yearly Performance, and Product & Customer Contribution were calculated.

🧠 Key Metrics & Calculations
To support analysis, the following metrics were created:
Total Revenue (Quantity × Unit Price)
Year-over-Year (YoY) Revenue Growth
Product-Level Revenue Contribution
Customer-Level Revenue Contribution
These metrics form the backbone of the dashboard’s insights.

🔍 Key Insights (From the Actual Data)
1️⃣ Strong Year-over-Year Growth
Revenue increased from ₦6.77M in 2023 to ₦7.76M in 2024, indicating a positive growth trajectory and improving sales performance.
👉 Business Meaning:
The company is growing, but growth sustainability needs deeper evaluation.
2️⃣ Revenue Concentration Risk
A small group of products and customers contributes a large share of total revenue.
👉 Business Meaning:
If one top product underperforms or a major customer leaves, total revenue could drop significantly.
3️⃣ Product Performance Imbalance
Only a few products dominate sales, while many others contribute very little.
👉 Business Meaning:
The product portfolio is not evenly optimized, creating inefficiencies in inventory and marketing spend.
4️⃣ Customer Value Inequality
Top customers generate far more revenue than the average customer.
👉 Business Meaning:
This presents both an opportunity (loyalty building) and a risk (over-dependence).
5️⃣ Time-Based Sales Patterns
Sales performance varies across time, showing predictable high- and low-performing periods.
👉 Business Meaning:
Better planning can significantly improve revenue without increasing costs.

🚀 Strategic Recommendations
✔ 1. Protect High-Value Customers
Introduce loyalty programs, exclusive offers, or priority service for top customers to reduce churn risk.
✔ 2. Diversify Revenue Sources
Actively grow mid-tier customers and promote underperforming products to reduce dependency on a few revenue drivers.
✔ 3. Focus on Best-Selling Products
Increase inventory availability, marketing exposure, and sales incentives around top-performing products.
✔ 4. Optimize Sales Planning Using Trends
Use time-based insights to plan promotions, staffing, and stock levels during high-demand periods.
✔ 5. Review Low-Performing Products
Evaluate whether low-performing products should be repositioned, bundled, or discontinued to improve profitability.
